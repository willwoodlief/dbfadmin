Database Entry from DBF files

Requirements
* the server has to be set up to run at least php 5.5
* the database has to be set up, the tables and data are in install/starting_database.sql.zip
* the config file has to be filled in , users/private_init.example.php is an example of it, just copy it
   and fill in the commented areas, and rename it by taking out the .example in the name
* permissions have to set for the tmp directory inside the project so php can read and write files there

There are two users already in the database, User and Admin
